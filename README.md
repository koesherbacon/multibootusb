What is multibootusb?
---------------------

MultiBootUSB is a cross platform* software/utility to create 
multi boot live Linux on a removable USB disk.
It is similar to UNetbootin but many distros can be 
installed, provided you have enough space on the disk.
MultiBootUSB also provides an option to uninstall distro(s) 
at any time, if you wish.

* Only works on windows and linux

## What does multibootusb do?

MultiBootUSB allows you to do the following:

1.  Install multiple live Linux and other Operating Systems 
to a USB disk and make it bootable without erasing existing 
data.
2.  Ability to uninstall installed OS later.
3.  Write ISO image directly to a USB disk (you can think of 
GUI for Linux `dd` command).
4.  Boot ISO images directly without rebooting your system 
using QEMU option.
5.  Boot bootable USBs without rebooting your system using 
QEMU option.
6.  Boot USB on UEFI/EFI system through GRUB2 bootloader 
(limited support).
